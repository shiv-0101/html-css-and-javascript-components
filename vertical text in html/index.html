        In the face of growing geopolitical tensions and the potential expansion
        of alliances such as NATO, climate change may not be the highest
        operational priority for the world 's militaries right now. For most,
        the impacts of climate change—drought, sea-level rise and extreme
        weather—are likely seen as operational stumbling blocks that can be
        overcome by building the overall resiliency and adaptability of their
        armies.
