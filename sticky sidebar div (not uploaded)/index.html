        <h1>Amazing Stories That inspires</h1>

          What was beyond the bend in the stream was unknown. Both were curious,
          but only one was brave enough to want to explore. That was the
          problem. There was always one that let fear rule her life. What if
          dogs were racist? Would they care about fur color….. “son, only play
          with other tan dogs”? Or maybe it would depend on breed, “honey, only
          play with other German Shepards, never poodles”. Better yet it could
          depend on occupation.

          “I’m a sled dog while you’re only a running companion, leave me
          alone”. Maybe the neighborhood they live in could be the way they
          choose which dogs to associate with and which to shun? Size could be
          the determining factor, “see how tall that dog is, they are probably
          dumb”. Luckily dogs don’t discriminate. Just watch at a dog park. Big
          black and white dogs wag their tails and play with tiny tan dogs. A
          service dog chases after the same ball as the off-duty police dog.

        So if dogs don’t discriminate then why do we? There were a variety of
        ways to win the game. James had played it long enough to know most of
        them and he could see what his opponent was trying to do. There was a
        simple counterattack that James could use and the game should be his.

          He began deploying it with the confidence of a veteran player who had
          been in this situation a thousand times in the past. So, it was with
          great surprise when his opponent used a move he had never before seen
          or anticipated to easily defeat him in the game. No matter how hard he
          tried, he couldn't give her a good explanation about what had
          happened. It didn't even really make sense to him. All he knew was
          that he froze at the moment and no matter how hard he tried to react,
          nothing in his body allowed him to move. It was as if he had instantly
          become a statue and although he could see what was taking place, he
          couldn't move to intervene. He knew that wasn't a satisfactory
          explanation even though it was the truth. She tried to explain that
          love wasn't like pie.

        There wasn't a set number of slices to be given out. There wasn't less
        to be given to one person if you wanted to give more to another. That
        after a set amount was given out it would all disappear. She tried to
        explain this, but it fell on deaf ears. The time to take action was now.
        All three men knew in their hearts this was the case, yet none of them
        moved a muscle to try. They were all watching and waiting for one of the
        others to make the first move so they could follow a step or two behind
        and help. The situation demanded a leader and all three men were
        followers.

          There was a leak in the boat. Nobody had yet noticed it, and nobody
          would for the next couple of hours. This was a problem since the boat
          was heading out to sea and while the leak was quite small at the
          moment, it would be much larger when it was ultimately discovered.
          John had planned it exactly this way. It's an unfortunate reality that
          we don't teach people how to make money (beyond getting a 9 to 5 job)
          as part of our education system. The truth is there are a lot of
          different, legitimate ways to make money. That doesn't mean they are
          easy and that you won't have to work hard to succeed, but it does mean
          that if you're willing to open your mind a bit you don't have to be
          stuck in an office from 9 to 5 for the next fifty years o your life.

          She tried to be patient during that time but she hadn't always managed
          to be as patient as she'd like. But today the opportunity had finally
          come. The thing she always imagined would make her the happiest person
          in the world was about to happen. She didn't know why at this specific
          time she all of a sudden felt sick inside. What were they eating? It
          didn't taste like anything she had ever eaten before and although she
          was famished, she didn't dare ask. She knew the answer would be one
          she didn't want to hear.

          He read about a hike called the incline in the guidebook. It said it
          was a strenuous hike and to bring plenty of water. “A beautiful hike
          to the clouds” described one review.

          “Not for the faint-hearted,” said another. “Not too bad of a workout”,
          bragged a third review. I thought I’d hike it when I fly in from
          Maryland on my day off from the senior citizen's wellness conference.
          I hiked 2 miles a day around the neighborhood so I could handle a
          1.1-mile hike. What a foolish mistake that was for a 70-year-old
          low-lander.

          It was their first date and she had been looking forward to it the
          entire week. She had her eyes on him for months, and it had taken a
          convoluted scheme with several friends to make it happen, but he'd
          finally taken the hint and asked her out. After all the time and
          effort she'd invested into it, she never thought that it would be
          anything but wonderful. It goes without saying that things didn't work
          out quite as she expected.
